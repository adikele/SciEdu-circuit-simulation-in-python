    <h1>Exercise 3. White Noise in Time and Frequency Domain</h1>
	<p>Make a block diagram as in Figure 5 where Signal Generator is set to Noise mode.</p>
	<img src="images/NoiseFigure5.svg" alt="NoiseFigure5">
	<p class="caption">Figure 5 Noise in Time and Frequency domain</p>
	<p class="question">1. Use the oscilloscope to measure the noise signal at the output of the signal generator. What kind of signal it is? </p>
	<form>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect" > Constant voltage
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="correct"> Random voltage
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect"> Sine wave
	</form>
	<p class="question">2. Measure the input signal with spectrum analyser. How does the spectrum of the noise signal look like?</p>
   <form>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="correct" > Spectrum is random and wide.
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect"> Spectrum is constant.
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect"> Spectrum is narrow and constant.
	</form>
	<p class="question">3. Set cut of frequency of LPF to 20 kHz. Look at the output of the filter with oscilloscope. What has happened to the noise signal shape because of filtering?</p>
    <form>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect" > It is changed to sine wave.
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="correct"> Rapid changes have disappeared.
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect"> It is changed to triangle wave.
	</form>
	<p class="question">4. Measure output signal of the low pass filter with the spectrum analyser. What has happened to the spectrum of noise?</p>
    <form>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect" > Spectrum remains the same as the LPF input spectrum.
		<br>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect"> Output spectrum is wider than at the input spectrum.
		<br>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="correct"> Output spectrum is narrow containing less high frequency content.
	</form>
	<p class="question">5. In general, what happens to signal shape when high frequency content is removed?</p>
    <form>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="correct" > It cannot change as rapidly because high frequencies are needed for rapid changes.
		<br>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect"> It changes more rapidly because high frequencies are removed.
		<br>
		<input type="radio" name="option" option="incorrect"> The shape of the signal remains the same.
	</form>
